  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>½ pound bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, softened </li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped parsley</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
  
 </ul>
 <h4>Steps</h4>

  <li>Beat together eggs and cream in a medium bowl until just blended. 
    Stir in Parmesan cheese and set aside.</li>
  <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
